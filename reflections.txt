  * What new skills have you learned?
      Having some prior exposure to HTML, I was able to quickly read/listen and go through the material to brush-up my skills on HTML 101 within a day. I was able to learn a few new HTML tags like superscript and horizontal rule.
  * What has been easy?
      So far, most of the exercises have been pretty easy and straight-forward. I was able to use my past familiarity with HTML to make early quick progress.
  * What has been difficult?
      Nothing so far - looking forward to more challenges and learning in the upcoming chapters.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
      I was able to use all the basic concepts learned to overcome the challenges so far and am looking to do the same throughout the course
